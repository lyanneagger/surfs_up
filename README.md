# Surf's Up

## Overview

### Weather Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to use temperature and precipitation measurements throughout Oahu to determine whether a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable throughout the year. The weather data was put into a SQLite database and filtered to compare weather in June and December.


## Results 

### June vs. December Temperatures

This analysis has shown several clear trends through the weather data:

* As pictured below, the average temperatures in June (left) and December (right) are not much different. June's average temperature is 74.9 degrees while December's is 71.0.
* The minimum temperatures for June and December are also fairly close together, with June's lowest recorded temperature at 64 degrees and December's at 56.
* The maximum temperatures in June was 85 degrees, and the maximum temperature in December was 83 degrees.

## Summary 

### Weather Trend Findings

Overall, the weather throughout the year is consistent enough in Oahu to support a surf and ice cream shop, with no major cold snaps throughout the year. The temperatures from summertime in June are within 10 degrees of the temperatures in December. 

### Additional Helpful Information

As pictured below, there were some rainy days, but only a few through the past year.

 It would be beneficial to perform additional queries comparing the number of rainy days or number of rain measurements in June and December. Looking at the duration of the rain may also provide some insight into how the weather pattern might affect business. For example, if there are several measurements taken in a day, it might discourage foot traffic into a surf and ice cream store compared to one measurement on an otherwise clear day. 

Another query that may be beneficial is to look at the extremes within the weather data. Identifying the highest temperatures, lowest temperatures, and rainiest days, weeks, or months will give valuable insight to how weather may play on business trends.
